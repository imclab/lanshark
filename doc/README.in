*Installation

*Web Interface
-
The webinterface is normally located at port 31337.

lanshark/webinterface. Please notice that the gui
only tries to guess your public ip address.

 - SHARE_PATH

the share path fpr the INCOMING_PATH so everything
you download with lanshark gets shared again.
-
*Config File
-
The for linux config file is located in
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lanshark/config. Which points normally
to ~/.config/lanshark/config

Just look at the comments (the lines starting
with a #).

used to match the icons in the config file.
The config key is called
